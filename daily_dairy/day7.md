**DAY 7(01/07/2025)**

Today we delved deep into the types of supervised and unsupervised learning:

1) **Types of Supervised Learning:**

   In Supervised Learning, we train the model using labeled data (input with known output).
   
   **i. Classification:-** Classification is about predicting a class or a discrete value. The output is a category or label. For example,  we have to predict whether it's a male or female. 

    **ii. Regression:-** Regression is about predicting a quantity or continuous values. For example, we need to predict the rainfall in centimeter for a given temperature or pressure. 

   The key difference between calssification and regression lies in the nature of the output: classification deals with discrete outcomes (e.g., yes/no categories), while regression handles continuous values (e.g., price, temperature).

2) **Types of Unsupervised Learning:**

   In Unsupervised Learning, we use unlabeled data and the model tries to find patterns on its own.

    **i. Clustering:-** It is an unsupervised task which involves grouping the similar data points together. Clustering algorithms work by repeatedly moving data points closer to the center of their group (cluster) and farther from points in other groups.
     Example: Say we get a project from a mobile network company and they want us to suggest some ways on how they can increase their user base and revenue. They provide us with their user data and we feed it to a clustering algorithm. After applying the algorithm, we discovered two user segments - one with high call duration but low internet usage, and another with high internet usage but low call duration. So, we can suggest them to give offers on internet usage for those people who are having a high call duration and less internet usage and give offers on call durations for people who are having less internet usage.

     **ii. Association:-** It is an unsupervised task that is used to find important relationship between data points. It looks for rules like “people who buy X often also buy Y”.
     Example: If a customer buys bread and butter, they are likely to also buy milk.
