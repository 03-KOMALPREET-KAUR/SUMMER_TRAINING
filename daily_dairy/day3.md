**DAY 3 (25/06/2025)**

Today i learnt the following things:
1) Data is the raw information, which can include numbers, words or images. AI learns from the data to find patterns and make predictions.
2) Data Modelling includes the technique to be followed to build an AI model. There are two main ways in which AI systems can be built -

a. **RULE BASED APPROACH**: In this approach, the system works by following a fixed set of rules written by humans. It has a limitation that if the system is tested on a different dataset from the rules or data fed in training stage, it will fail and will not learn from the new conditions encountered.

b. **LEARNING BASED APPROACH**: This approach allows the AI to learn patterns and rules from data instead of being explicitly told what to do. It is further divided into 3 categories:
  
   i. SUPERVISED LEARNING: In Supervised Learning, the AI is trained using labeled data â€“ that means we give it both the input (X) and the correct output (Y).
  
   ii. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING: In Unsupervised Learning, there are no labels. We only give AI the input data (X), and it has to find patterns on its own.
   
   iii. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING: In this type of learning based approach, the AI learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments.
