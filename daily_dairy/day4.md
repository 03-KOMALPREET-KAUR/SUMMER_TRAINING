**DAY 4 (26/06/2025)**

Today i learnt about the stages of AI Project Cycle. It included the following points:
1) There are mainly 5 stages of developing an AI project:

**i. PROBLEM SCOPING:** This stage focuses on identifying and understanding the problem using 4Ws- WHO(who are the people that would be benefitted with the solution), WHAT(What is the problem and how do you know that it is a problem), WHERE(It includes looking into the situation where problem arises and the locations where it is prominent), WHY(Why you want to solve this problem)

**ii. DATA COLLECTION:** It is the process of collecting data required for training the AI model.

**iii. DATA PREPROCESSING:** It includes cleaning and preparing the data so that AI can understand it (e.g., removing missing values).

**iv. DATA MODELLING:** This stage include choosing the best algorithm (like supervised, unsupervised learning) based on the problem and then feeding the prepared data into the model so that it can learn patterns.

**v. MODEL EVALUATION:** This stage includes checking how well the model performs using testing data. The testing data is given as input to the newly created model and the output received is checked and evaluated on the basis of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
