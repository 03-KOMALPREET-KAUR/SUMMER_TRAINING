**DAY 11(07/07/2025)**

Today we studied about the importance of data in a ML project and how to collect data.

1) **Importance of Data Collection**: Data collection is a critical step in any AI project.
  
   a) **Foundation for Analysis**: The quality of insights, predictions, or decisions depends on the quality of the collected data.
      Good data → Good models → Better outcomes.

   b) **Understanding the Problem:** Data helps define the problem space and ask better questions.

   c) **Training Machine Learning Models:** Models learn from data. Without sufficient and diverse data, models can’t generalize well.

   d) **Performance & Accuracy:** Poor or biased data leads to inaccurate results. High-quality, diverse datasets improve model accuracy.

3) **Where to Collect Data From?**

   a) **Kaggle:** It is a popular platform for data science competitions. It has a huge collection of open datasets across fields like finance, health, retail, sports, etc. Each dataset comes with metadata, discussion, and often code notebooks.

   b) **UCI Machine Learning Repository:** It is one of the oldest sources of machine learning datasets. It has many benchmark datasets like Iris, Adult, Breast Cancer, etc.

   c) **Google Dataset Search:**   It is like Google Search, but specifically for datasets.

4) **Using Kaggle API to Import Datasets:**

   **Step 1:** Create a Kaggle Account.

   **Step 2:** Get Your Kaggle API Token. Click “Create New API Token” and a file called kaggle.json will download.

   **Step 3:** Place the kaggle.json file Properly. Upload the kaggle.json file when prompted. Then move it to the right location.

   **Step 4:** Install Kaggle API.

   **Step 5:** Find Dataset Name or URL on Kaggle.

   **Step 6:** Download the Dataset. We get a zipped file in the working directory.

   **Step 7:** Unzip the Dataset. Then, the data is ready to use with Pandas.
