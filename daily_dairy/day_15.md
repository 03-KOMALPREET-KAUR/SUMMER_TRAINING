**DAY 15(11/07/2025)**

Today, I explored one of the core pillars of statistical reasoning â€” Probability and its critical role in machine learning and data science.

1)  **What is Probability?**

    Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with quantifying uncertainty. It helps measure the likelihood of occurrence of an event and is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.

    In ML, probability allows us to make predictions, model uncertainty, and infer patterns from data.

2) **Random Variables:** A random variable is a numerical description of the outcomes of random events. It assigns a number to each outcome in a sample space i.e. it maps the outcomes of random events to numerical values.

3) **Types of Random Variables:** There are two types of random variables.

   a) **Discrete Random Variable:** It takes only discrete or distinct values. Example, Coin toss, Color of the ball.

   b) **Continuous Random Variable:** It takes on values from a continuous range. Example, height, temperature, weight.

4) **Probability Distribution:** The probability distribution for a random variable describes how the probabilities are distributed over the values of the random variable.

5) **Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):** A normal distribution is an arrangement of a dataset in which most of the data points lie in the middle of the range and the rest taper off symmetrically toward either extreme. It is bell-shaped and symmetric around the mean.

6) **Skewness:** A data is considered to be skewed when the distribution curve appears distorted or skewed either to the left or to the right, in a statistical distribution. Skewness measures the asymmetry of a probability distribution.

   If data is symmetrical, it's normally distributed (no skew).

   If data has a long tail on one side, it's skewed (positive or negative).

   a) **Normal Distribution (No Skew)**

      **Shape:** Symmetrical bell-shaped curve.

      **Mean = Median = Mode**

      **Tails:** Evenly distributed on both sides.

      **Example:** Heights of adults

   b) **Positively Skewed Distribution (Right Skewed)**

      **Shape:** Tail stretches to the right.

      **Mean>Median>Mode**

      Most data values are **small**, with a few large outliers.

      **Example:** Income distribution (few people earn a lot more).

   c) **Negatively Skewed Distribution (Left Skewed)**
   
      **Shape:** Tail stretches to the left.

      **Mean<Median<Mode**

      Most data values are **high**, with a few small outliers.

      **Example:** Exam scores where many students score high and a few very low.

7) **Poisson Distribution:** It is a probability distribution that measures how many times an event is likely to occur within a specified period of time. It is used to understand independent events that occur at a constant rate within a given interval of time.

   **Examples of Poisson Distribution** - Number of accidents occuring in a city from 6 pm to 10 pm, How many views does your blog gets in a day, Number of emails received per hour.
