**DAY 14(10/07/2025)**

Today we were taught about the statistics which is needed for machine learning.

1) **Role of Statistics in Machine Learning:** Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analysing, interpreting and presenting data. Statistics helps us understand data, draw insights, and make data-driven decisions. It is crucial in:

   - Identifying patterns

   - Handling missing values

   - Feature selection and engineering

   - Model evaluation
  
2) **Types of Data:**
   
    a) **Categorical Data** (non-numerical): It has further two types.
   
    - **Nominal**: No natural order (e.g., gender, colors)

    - **Ordinal**: Has a meaningful order (e.g., rankings, satisfaction levels)

    b) **Numerical Data:** It has further two types.

    - **Discrete:** Type of data that can take only certain values. (e.g., number of students in a class)

    - **Continuous:** Type of data that can have almost any numeric value. (e.g., height, temperature)

3) **Types of Statistics:**

     a) **Descriptive Statistics:** It is used to describe the basic features of the data in a study. It provides simple summary about the sample and the measures.

     b) **Inferential Statistics:** It takes data from a sample and makes inferences and predictions about the larger population from which the sample was drawn.

4) **Types of Statistical Studies:**
   
   a) **Sample Study:** A sample study is a study which is carried out on a sample which represents the total population.
   
   b) **Observational Study:** An observational study is a study where we simply collect and analyze data. We won't inject any changes. We just observe the correlation in the data.

   c) **Experimental Study:** An experimental study is a study in which conditions are controlled and manipulated by the experimenter.

5) **Sampling Techniques:**
  
   **A. Probability Sampling:** Probability sampling is a sampling technique in which every member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected. It has the following types-

     a) **Simple Random Sampling:** In this, the sample is randomly picked from a larger population. Hence, all the individual datapoints have an equal probability to be selected as a sample data.

       PROS: No sample bias, Balanced Sample, Simple method of sampling, Requires less domain knowledge.

       CONS: Population size should be high, Cannot represent the population well in some cases.

     b) **Systematic Sampling:** In this, the sample is picked from the population at regular intervals. This type of sampling is carried out if the population is homogenous and the data points are uniformly distributed.

       PROS: Quick and easy to implement, Less bias, Even distribution of data.

       CONS: Data manipulation risk, Patterns in population may bias the sample.

     c) **Stratified Sampling:** In this, the population is subdivided into smaller groups called **Strata**. Samples are obtained randomly from **all** these strata.

       PROS: Finds important characteristics in the population, Ensures representation.

       CONS: Cannot be performed on populations that cannot be classified into groups.

     d) **Cluster Sampling:** It is carried out on population that has inherent groups. This population is subdivided into **clusters** and then random clusters are taken as sample.

       PROS: Reduced variability, Advantages of both random and stratified sampling.

       CONS: Cannot be performed on populations without natural groups, Cannot provide a general insight for the entire population.

   **B. Non-Probability Sampling:** Non-probability sampling is a sampling technique in which not all members of the population have a known or equal chance of being selected.

8) **Measures of Central Tendencies:** 

   a) **Mean:** Mean or arithmetic mean is the sum of values divided by the number of values.

   b) **Median:** Median is the middle value in the list of numbers. To find the median, the numbers have to be listed in numerical order from smallest to largest.

   c) **Mode:** Mode is the value that occurs most often.

    MEAN - Good for symmetric distributions

    MEDIAN - Best for skewed data

    MODE - Useful for categorical data

9) **Measures of Variability:**
   
   a) **Range:** Range is the difference between maximum and minimum values.

   b) **Variance:** Variance is the average of squared differences from the mean.

   c) **Standard Deviation:** Standard Deviation is the square root of variance. It is widely used to understand how spread out the data is.

10) **Percentiles and Quantiles:**
   
    a) **Percentile:** It is a value on the scale of 100 that indicates the percent of distribution that is equal to or below it.

    b) **Quantiles:** It is a measure that tells how many values in a dataset are above or below a certain limit. It divides the members of the dataset into **equally-sized** subgroups.

12) **Correlation and Causation:**
    
    a) **Correlation:** Correlation is a measure that determines the extent to which two variables are related to each other in a dataset. But, it does not mean that one event is the cause of other event.

    b) Causation: Causation means that one event causes another event to occur, i.e. there is a **cause-effect** relationship between the two variables.

14) **Hypothesis Testing:** Hypothesis is an assumption that is made based on the observations of an experiment.

    a) **Null Hypothesis:** It is the commonly accepted fact.

    b) **Alternative Hypothesis:** It is opposite to null hypothesis and challenges the null hypothesis.
