DAY 5 (27/06/2025)
 
1) Today, we were introduced to the basic concepts of python including:
i. Variables(used to store values)
ii. Datatypes and Operators
iii. Lists(store datasets like temperature readings for weather prediction models)
iv. Dictionaries(help to store labelled data, like mapping students to their test scores for analyzing performance)
v. if-else conditions(used in past to create simple rule-based AI)

2) Some of the open-source packages which are needed for Artificial Intelligence are:
   
**i. NumPy(Numerical Python):** It is used to work with arrays. For example, storing image pixels.

**ii. Pandas:** It helps in handling data tables. For example: storing a dataset of students with names, marks, and attendance.

**iii. Matplotlib:** It is a library used for data visualization. It helps to draw graphs, charts, and plots to understand data better.

**iv. OpenCV:** It is an image processing package used for manipulating and processing of images like cropping, resizing, editing, etc.
