**DAY 8(02/07/2025)**

Today we were taught the basic concepts of python in deep with examples.

1) **Variables** : Variables are used to store data. We can think of them as containers that hold information.
   
2) **print() function** : The print() function is used to display output on the screen. We learned how to print variables and also how to get a formatted output using f-string.
    
3) **input() function** : The input() function allows the user to enter data from the keyboard. Also, the input() function always takes string input. To use numbers, we have to convert it using int() or float().
   
4) **Data Types :** The basic datatypes in python are **Integer, Floating Point, Complex, Boolean and string.** We can convert one datatype to another, for example, we can convert int to float by using float() and float to int by using int(). The Boolean datatype returns True or False values. Then we also studied about the slicing and concatenation of string.
   
5) **Mutable and immutable objects:** There are two types of objects in Python. **Immutable** objects are those whose values cannot be changed(for example, int, float, string, bool ,tuple) and **Mutable** objects are those whose values can be changed(for example, list, set, dictionary).
    
6) **List:** A list is a collection of items that is ordered and **mutable**. List is included in the square brackets and items in the list can be of different types. It also allows duplicate values and supports indexing and slicing. We can add a new element in the list by using append() method(adds one element at the end), insert() method(adds element at a specific index) and extend() method(adds multiple elements). We can delete an element from list by using remove() method(deletes by value) and del(deletes by index or deletes entire list).
    
7) **Tuple:**   A tuple is like a list but it is **immutable**. We can convert a list to tuple by using tuple(). We cannot add or delete an element from the tuple. It can also store data items of different types and it supports indexing.
    
8) **Set:** A set is unordered and **mutable**, and no duplicate values are allowed in a set. It automatically removes duplicates. It cannot have indexing or slicing. It is written using curly brackets. We can convert a list to set using set().
    
9) **Dictionary:** A dictionary stores data in **key-value pairs**. It does not allow duplicate values and it is mutable.
    
10) **Operators:** There are many types of operator including **arithmetic** operators(addition,subtraction,multiplication,division,modulus,exponentiation), **assignment** operators(=,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=,**=), **comparison operators**(==,!=,<,>,<=,>=), **logical operators**(and,or,not), **identity operators**(is, is not) and **membership operators**(in , not in).
    
11) **Conditional Statements:** These are used to make decisions. **if** statement(executes a block only if the condition is true),**if-else** statement(chooses between two options), **if-elif-else** statement(checks multiple conditions one after the other) and **nested if-else**(an if inside another if or else).
    
12) **Loops:** They are used to repeat a block of code. **for** loop(repeats over a range) and **while** loop(runs as long as the condition is True).
    
13) **Functions:** A function is a block of reusable code that can be called again and again.
