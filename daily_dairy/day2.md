**DAY 2 (24/06/2025)**

Today i learnt the following things related to Artificial Intelligence:
1) The steps to follow in using AI are - Data or X(Input), Selected Intelligence or F(X) (Function) and Predictions or Y(Output). We not always need to build an AI from scratch. We can simply use the codes of AI already created, which are available as open source and then by following the steps mentioned earlier, we can use this in our project.
2) It is not possible to run an AI code locally on computer/laptop because it is difficult to setup the software stacks required and moreover, costly computers are needed to run neural networks.
The solution to this is to run the code on Cloud - i.e. on GOOGLE COLAB.
3) We learnt to create a simple Colab notebook. We went through a colab notebook which showed how to train an AI to perform simple addition. It was trained using just five datapoints which were all positive numbers.
So, when we tested the model with negative numbers, it could not give good results as it was trained only using positive numbers. This shows that AI must be trained on a wide range of dataset so that it can predict accurately for any type of data.
4) Then, we looked upon the journey of data - in the period from 1990-2000, with the help of internet, data grew fast and hence AI started learning from large amounts of text and images.
And now that we are having billions of images, text and videos from the internet with every field (including agriculture, finance, etc) generating its own wide dataset, AI can now chat, translate languages, drive cars and do many more fascinating things!
