# SUMMER_TRAINING
This is a repository for the daily dairy of my summer internship under Dr. Sandeep Singh Sandha, Punjab AI Excellence.

**DAY 1 (23/06/2025)**

Today was a day full of excitement and enthusiasm as i started with my summer internship as a Data Scientist under the mentorship of Dr. Sandeep Singh Sandha.
Sir introduced us with the basic concepts of AI and the steps which need to be followed while making any AI project. 
The things which i learnt today include:
1) Evolution of society has been very rapid. In late 18th to early 19th century, Fuel-based revlution took place which is known as the age of INDUSTRY. In late 19th century, Electricity came into picture which is the age of POWER. Then in late 20th century, Internet completely revolutionised the way we communicate and this was the age of CONNECTIVITY. Now, we have entered the field of Artificial Intelligence , i.e. the age of INTELLIGENCE which is revolutionizing every aspect of our life.
2) AI is a system that can perform tasks that normally require humna intelligence, and it can even supass human performance.
3) AI can - WRITE LIKE HUMANS(e.g. chatgpt can write blogs, essays for us), TALK LIKE HUMNAS(e.g. Siri, Google assistant, Alexa) , SEE LIKE HUMANS (Ai systems can recognize objects and text in images).
4) There are 4 steps in creating AI - **DATA COLLECTION**(collect relevant text, images, etc related to your project), **SELECTION OF INTELLIGENCE**(it includes choosing which type of model fits best, e.g. neural networks), **TRAINING AI** (it includes training the model to learn patterns from data so that it can make predictions or decisions) , **EVALUATING/TESTING AI** (finally we check how well the trained model performs on unseen data to ensure that it gives accurate and reliable results).
